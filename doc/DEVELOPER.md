Code mostly try to follow Python standards (PEP).
Indent used are `2` white-space

Code tests were made on Katana 4.5v1.


# Using outside of Katana

You can remove the `"[OpScript]"` log message prefix by modifying the 
`_log` method of the `Logger` class.

Everything else should work outside of Katana and is compatible with the 
standard lua library.
