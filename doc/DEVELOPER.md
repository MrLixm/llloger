Section related to code development.

Code mostly try to follow Python standards (PEP) for syntax.
Indent used are `2` white-space.

By default of not knowing what are the lua standard for documenting code
with type hints, I used the python ones which are Google style docstrings.


Tested on `Lua 5.1.5`.

## Tests

There is no actually proper unittest that will raise errors but you have at least
a test file in [../tests/test_lllogger.lua](../tests/test_lllogger.lua) that you
can run and _parse visually by yourself_ to check for issues.
